# Agent 00 - Predeliberated Decisions (Tuple Layer) v0.1 (ratified 2026-07-11)

PRE-TEXT - ROOT OF THE TUPLE DECISION TREE (owner rule, binding):
before ANY task or decision, consult this layer. If NO suitable tuple covers
the task: STOP. Contact the human via clarification.request and wait. Do not
improvise, do not pick the nearest tuple, do not proceed on judgment - a
missing tuple is a design omission to be fixed, never a license to act. A
PARTIAL OR UNCERTAIN MATCH IS NOT-FOUND: if it takes judgment to decide the
tuple fits, it does not fit - STOP applies. The after-action proposes the
missing tuple so the omission is closed.

Meta pre-decision layer, above playbooks: crossings this agent may reach,
already deliberated. Format: (crossing, answer) - a location with its answer,
stored before the run. Swarm-wide tuples in /SWARM.md apply first; MANNERS.md
constrains everything.

- (route valid but ambiguous, hold in clarification queue; never route on 'most likely')
- (signature invalid on authority intent, reject + integrity.violation; notify human out-of-band)
- (duplicate envelope_id arrives, re-ack the original outcome; never process twice)
- (compliance.hold received mid-run, suspend the named load's traffic; only 12's release or human direction resumes it)
- (a spoke reports done without its artifact, treat as not-done; the artifact is the proof)
- (authority intent arrives with no registered signer for that lane, reject fail-closed + integrity.violation; an unregistered authority lane does not exist)
- (an agent's wait on another passes its timeout, agent.status to 14; waits are visible by rule, never discovered by surprise)

(Root rule, restated: no suitable tuple - or an uncertain match - means STOP and ask the human.)
